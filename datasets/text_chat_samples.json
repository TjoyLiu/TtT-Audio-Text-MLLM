A group is cyclic if it is generated by a single element, but this isn't guaranteed for a group of order 35. (C) G must be a direct product of cyclic groups: This is correct.

The logistic map is given by the equation:\n\nx(n+1) = r * x(n) * (1 - x(n))\n\nFor r = 3.2, we first need to find the fixed point x. To do this, we set x(n+1) = x(n) = x and solve for x:\n\nx = 3.2 * x * (1 - x)\n\nx - 3.2x^2 = 0\n\nx(1 - 3.2x) = 0\n\nThis equation has two solutions: x = 0 and x = 1/3.2. Since the fixed point should be in the interval (0, 1), we choose x = 1/3.2.\n\nNow, we can calculate the Lyapunov exponent:\n\nλ = ln |3.2 - 2 * 3.2 * (1/3.2)|\n\nλ = ln |3.2 - 2|\n\nλ = ln(1.2)\n\nλ ≈ 0.1823\n\nSo, the Lyapunov exponent for the logistic map with r = 3.2 is approximately 0.1823.",

In this case, the point (0.25, 0.5) corresponds to the complex number z = 0.25 + 0.5i, and c = -0.4 + 0.6i.\n\nThe point is considered to be in the Julia set if the magnitude of z (|z|) does not exceed a certain threshold (usually 2) after a maximum number of iterations. The number of iterations required to determine if a point is in the Julia set depends on the desired level of accuracy. A common choice for the maximum number of iterations is 1000, but it can be higher or lower depending on the desired precision.\n\nLet's calculate the first few iterations of the function f(z) for the given point and complex number c:\n\n1. z1 = (0.25 + 0.5i)^2 + (-0.4 + 0.6i) = (-0.015 + 0.3i) + (-0.4 + 0.6i) = -0.415 + 0.9i\n2. z2 = (-0.415 + 0.9i)^2 + (-0.4 + 0.6i) = (-0.6715 - 0.747i) + (-0.4 + 0.6i) = -1.0715 - 0.147i\n3. z3 = (-1.0715 - 0.147i)^2 + (-0.4 + 0.6i) = (0.01210225 - 0.31542i) + (-0.4 + 0.6i) = -0.38789775 + 0.28458i\n\nWe can continue this process for the desired number of iterations. If the magnitude of z remains below the threshold (2) after the maximum number of iterations, the point is considered to be part of the Julia set. If the magnitude of z exceeds the threshold before reaching the maximum number of iterations, the point is not part of the Julia set.\n\nIn this case, we cannot determine the exact maximum number of iterations required without specifying the desired level of accuracy.
